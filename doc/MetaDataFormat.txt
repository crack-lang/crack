This is the format of crack's meta-data (".crkm") cache files.  These files
contain a binary representation of the interface of a module.

There are two primitive types defined by the crack serializer (see
model/Serializer.h), unsigned integers and blobs.

Unsigned integers are stored as a variable length sequence of bytes (just like
"VarInts" in Google protocol buffers), in which each byte consists of a single
high-bit which is zero if the byte is the last byte in the number followed by
7 bits of value.  The first byte is the low byte, the last is the high byte.

For example, we would represent 385 (0x181) with the byte sequence:
"0x81 0x03",  0x181's low seven bits = 0x01, which is not the last, so we set
the high bit and get 0x81,
The next seven bits are 0x03, which is the last so we get 0x03.

Blobs consist of an unsigned integer (uint) describing the number of bytes
that follow comprising the body of the blob.   For example, we would represent
the ascii string "text" as the hex sequence:

    04 74 65 78 74
    /   \  | |  /
# bytes  t e x t

What follows is a description of the meta-data serialization format in a
loosely crack-like definition language.  Some non-obvious definitions:

array[type] is a uint "count" followed by count instances of "type"

ref[type] is a way to define and reference objects that exist more than once
in the serialized data, including objects that are self-referential.  It is
stored as a uint object identifier followed by an instance of type if this is
the first occurrence (the "definition") of the instance.  The identifier has
a low-bit of 1 in this case, a low bit of zero if it is merely a reference to
an existing instance.  For example, if we had some object represented by
<data>, the first time we serialized it we might serialze it as "07 <data>",
the second time simply as "06".  In this example, the object id is actually
3, we shift by one and set the low-bit to 1 when it is initially defined.  (I
don't think the "first definition" bit was strictly necessary).

For structures with "optional" fields, we use a modified form of Google protobuf conventions.
Optional fields are serialized as a blob somewhere in the structure.  If the
structure has optional fields, but none are present for a particular instance,
this blob gets serialized as a single zero value byte.  For every optional
field that is present, we start with a uint describing the field and its type
and then its data (see the protobuf documentation for details on how this
works).  In these cases, we describe these fields as:

    optional type name = tag

So, for example:

    optional blob someName = 1

We override wire type 3 (the deprecated "begin group" type) for reference
types.  Since the size of these types can not be known without knowledge of
the field, we have to impose an order on optional data fields to preserve
backwards compatibility.  A reader may read the optional area until it
encounters a field tag for a reference type that it doesn't recognize, then
ignore the remainder of the area, so reference types must come last.

So given this, our meta-data format is:

{{
    MetaDataFile {
        # the header is the information that is to be read before we bother
        # reading the meta-data.  It must contain everything we need to
        # determine whether the use of the cache is acceptable for this module.
        Header header

        # the type declarations.  These inherently get an object id based on
        # their order, starting with 1 (0 is the object id for the model)

        # the module meta-data.
