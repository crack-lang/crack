- convert string constants to StaticString.
- functions to stream definitions and expressions.
- copyrights
-   cleanup:
    -   combine FuncDef and OverloadDef into a base class with a virtual 
        matches() for arg list defs, or just make FuncDef a smaller thing and 
        always use OverloadDef
    -   need to be able to define "oper" funcs.  Make "release", "init" and 
        "bind" oper funcs.
-   function arguments are currently SSA values, which means this won't work:
    type func(int a) { a = 100; }
-   nested compilation so I can write lots of unit tests (shell scripted unit 
    tests are working just fine)


Roadmap
-------

for 0.1:
-   allow utf-8 chars for strings and identifiers.
-   composition of constructors/destructors
-   the "oper" keyword
-   "Foo x = {1, 2}" construction syntax.
-   the '`' operator
-   break & continue
-   short circuit logic operators
-   floating point types
-   Should be able to do instance construction in a statement context without 
    it being misinterpreted as a defitition
-   empty statements should work: if (false) ;
-   global variables should not get cleaned up until the end of the program.
-   multiple inheritence shouldn't cause bad errors (it need not work)
-   numeric negation: "int j = -i;"

for 1.0:
-   doc-comments
-   first class functions
-   keyword arguments
-   sequence construction 
-   type inference
-   for/in loops
-   exceptions
