Crack ToDo File & Project Plan
==============================

Unassigned
----------

-   make operator overloads internal to classes.
-   allow explicit operators to be called without the "var." prefix.
-   need to be able to instantiate a class from within the class (generate the 
    "new" operator as soon as an "init" is defined).
-   give an error when you try to derive from a low-level type.
-   implement inheritence from low-level types.
-   need to be able to instantiate objects from within the class (i.e. oper 
    new must be generated after oper init is parsed)
-   annotations


Roadmap
-------

for 0.1:
-   floating point types

Completed for 0.1:
-   fix instance variable default initialization: 
    class A { B b; oper init() {} } doesn't construct 'b'. DONE
-   The implicit "oper del" does not override correctly (see to_test.crk) DONE
-   type casting. DONE
-   short circuit logic operators DONE
-   global variables should not get cleaned up until the end of the program.
    DONE.
-   fix cleanups during assignment (a = b does b.bind() but not a.release())
    DONE
-   composition of constructors/destructors DONE
-   allow utf-8 chars for strings and identifiers.  DONE
-   the '`' operator DONE
-   multiple inheritence shouldn't cause bad errors (it need not work) DONE 
    (it now works).
-   fix overload bug DONE
-   numeric negation: "int j = -i;" DONE
-   "Foo x = {1, 2}" construction syntax. DONE
-   break & continue DONE
-   explicit base class method invocation syntax (void foo() {Super.foo();}) 
    DONE
-   empty statements should work: if (false) ; DONE
-   get rid of the semicolon after class definitions DONE
-   the "oper" keyword
    -   general implementation DONE
    -   oper init initializers, oper del cleanups
        -   preserve order of definition during member initialization and 
            destruction DONE
    -   need syntax to allow calling "oper" functions from an expression, need 
        to get rid of the __del() hack. DONE
-   need to define comparison operators for Object in crack.lang and make them 
    part of the standard imports. DONE
-   fix numeric conversion. DONE
-   Should be able to do instance construction in a statement context without 
    it being misinterpreted as a definition DONE
-   need access to argv DONE

for 1.0:
-   cleanup:
    -   combine FuncDef and OverloadDef into a base class with a virtual 
        matches() for arg list defs, or just make FuncDef a smaller thing and 
        always use OverloadDef
    -   allowing turning off code generation by replacing the builder with a 
        "NullBuilder"  NullResultExpr follows:
            class NullResultExpr : public ResultExpr {
                public:
                    // won't work, need a non-null ResultExpr value
                    NullResultExpr() : ResultExpr(0) {} 
                    
                    ResultExprPtr emit(Context &context) {
                        return this;
                    }
            };
    
        
-   function arguments are currently SSA values, which means this won't work:
    type func(int a) { a = 100; }
-   doc-comments
-   first class functions (including overload selection: func[Type1, Type2])
-   keyword arguments
-   sequence construction 
-   type inference
-   for/in loops
-   exceptions
-   minor features
-   string interpolation expressions: s := `some string $val`;
    -   warn the user when an overload hides an earlier overload (foo(String) 
        following foo(Object), for example).
