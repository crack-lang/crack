Crack ToDo File & Project Plan
==============================

Copyright 2009 Google Inc.

-   @struct doesn't deal with internal doc-comments correctly.
-   Remove generic line information from the meta-digest

Unassigned
----------

-   allow explicit operators to be called without the "var." prefix.
-   implement inheritence from low-level types.

Roadmap
-------

for 1.0:
-   cleanup:
    -   combine FuncDef and OverloadDef into a base class with a virtual 
        matches() for arg list defs, or just make FuncDef a smaller thing and 
        always use OverloadDef
    -   allowing turning off code generation by replacing the builder with a 
        "NullBuilder"  NullResultExpr follows:
            class NullResultExpr : public ResultExpr {
                public:
                    // won't work, need a non-null ResultExpr value
                    NullResultExpr() : ResultExpr(0) {} 
                    
                    ResultExprPtr emit(Context &context) {
                        return this;
                    }
            };
    
        
-   first class functions (including overload selection: func[Type1, Type2])
-   keyword arguments
-   sequence construction 
-   type inference
-   minor features
-   string interpolation expressions: s := `some string $val`;
-   warn the user when an overload hides an earlier overload (foo(String) 
    following foo(Object), for example).
